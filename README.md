####This site is built using the following tools:

1. Ruby on Rails as the back end framework
2. Carrierwave gem for uploading images
3. Devise for login
3. Ransack gem for searching
4. Act as votable gem for liking projects
5. Elements from Bootstrap CSS framwork
6. Custom CSS3


####User Story
Artists can signup, create a profile and then are able to upload projects - work they have done. They can write information about the project embed videos and upload stills. Once you are a member of the community you can view other artists work and view there profiles for networking, collaberating purposes. Please see my preparation work including tables and wireframes.
