This is a site developed to build an online community of artists who work with visuals and sound primarily using sound as a focus in the work. I am foocusing on work in the following categories:

Artists who work with visuals and sound and deliver to a range of enviorments: 
this site will focus on:

- Installation
- Video Art
- Music Festival
- Performance
- Music Video
- Dev art

This site is built using the following tools:

1. Ruby on Rails as the back end framework
2. Carrierwave gem for uploading images
3. Devise for login
3. Ransack gem
4. Act as votable gem for liking projects
5. Elements from Bootstrap CSS framwork
6. Custom CSS3
7. 

####User Story
Artists can signup, create a profile and then are able to upload projects - work they have done. They can write information about the project embed videos and upload stills. Once you are a member of the community you can view other artists work and view there profiles for networking, collaberating purposes. Please see my preparation work including tables and wireframes.
